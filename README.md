# What's up ðŸ‘‹!
I'm Ayaan, a typical 11 y/o who's addicted to computers and programming, maybe a little too much ðŸ˜…. I'm also a professional at procrastinating!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently *volunteering* doing Web Development using the **Django** web framework and **mentoring** people learning to code on Exercism.
- ðŸŒ± I'm mainly learning **JavaScript** and also learning **Machine Learning** on the side!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool, open source project :D
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, Him

I love programming all sorts of projects, and also teaching programming on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustProgram)!
